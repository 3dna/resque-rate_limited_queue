# Resque Rate Limited Queue

A Resque plugin which makes handling jobs that use rate limited apis easier

If you have a series of jobs in a queue, this gem will pause the queue when one of the jobs hits a rate limit, and re-start the queue when the rate limit has expired.

There are two ways to use the gem.

If the api you are using has a dedicated queue included in the gem (currently Twitter, Angellist and Evernote) then you just need to make some very minor changes to how you queue jobs, and the gem will do the rest.

If you are using another API, then you need to write a little code that catches the rate limit signal.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'resque-rate-limited-queue'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-rate-limited-queue

## Usage

### Configuration
#### Redis
The gem uses [redis-mutex](https://github.com/kenn/redis-mutex ) which requires you to register the Redis server: (e.g. in `config/initializers/redis_mutex.rb` for Rails)

```ruby
RedisClassy.redis = Redis.new
```
Note that Redis Mutex uses the `redis-classy` gem internally.

#### Un Pause
Queues can be unpaused in two ways. 

The most elegant is using [resque-scheduler](https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler), this works well as long as you aren't running on a platform like heroku which requires a dedicated worker to run the resque-scheduler.

To tell the gem to use resque-scheduler you need to include resque-scheduler in your Gemfile - and also let the gem know which queue to use to schedule the unpause job (make sure this isn't a queue that could get paused). Put this in an initializer.

```ruby
Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue::UnPause.queue = :my_queue
```

Please see the section below on how to unpause on heroku as an alternative. If you don't install resque-scheduler AND configure the queue, then the gem will not schedule unpause jobs this way.

#### Workers
Queues are paused by renaming them, so a resque queue called 'twitter\_api' will be renamed 'twitter\_api\_paused' when it hits a rate limit. Of course this will only work if your resque workers are not also taking jobs from the 'twitter\_api\_paused' queue. So your worker commands need to look like:

Either
```ruby
bin/resque work --queues=high,low,twitter_api
```
or
```ruby
env QUEUES=high,low,twitter_api bundle exec rake jobs:work
```

NOT
```ruby
bin/resque work --queues=*
```
or NOT
```ruby
env QUEUES=* bundle exec rake jobs:work
```

#### Unpausing on heroku
The built in schedler on heroku doesn't support dynamic scheduling from an API, so unless you want to provision an extra worker to run resque-scheduler - the best option is just to unpause all your queues on a regular basis. If they aren't paused this is a harmless no-op. If not enough time has elapsed the jobs will just hit the rate_limit and get paused again. We've found that a hourly 'rake unpause' job seems to work well.

```ruby
Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue.un_pause('twitter_api')
Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue.un_pause('angellist_api')
Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue.un_pause('evernote_api')
```
### A Pausable job using one of the build-in queues (Twitter, Angellist, Evernote)
If you're using the [Twitter Gem[ (https://github.com/sferik/twitter)
This is really simple. Instead of queuing using Resque.enqueue, you just use Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue:TwitterQueue.enqueue. Make sure your code in perform doesn't catch the rate_limit exception.

The TwitterQueue will catch the exception and pause the queue (and schedule an un pause if you are using resque-scheduler). Any jobs you add while the queue is paused will be added to the paused queue

```ruby
class TwitterJob
  class << self
    def refresh(handle)
      Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue:TwitterQueue.enqueue(TwitterJob, handle)
    end
    
    def perform(handle)
      do_something_with_the_twitter_gem(handle)
    end
  end
end
```

### A single class of pausable job using another api
If you only have one class of job you want to queue to the api, then you can use the PauseQueue module directly

```ruby
class MyApiJob
  extend Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue
  @queue = :my_api
  WAIT_TIME = 60*60

  def self.perform(*params)
    do_api_stuff
  rescue MyApiRateLimit
    pause_for(Time.now + WAIT_TIME, name)
    rate_limited_requeue(self, *params)
  end

  def self.enqueue(*params)
    rate_limited_enqueue(self, *params)
  end
end
````

### A multiple classes of pausable job using another api
If you have more than one class of job you want to queue to the api, then you can need to add another Queue class. This isn't hard

```ruby
class MyApiQueue
  extend Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue
  @queue = :my_api
  WAIT_TIME = 60*60

  def self.perform(klass, *params)
    Resque::Plugins::RateLimitedQueue.class_from_string(klass).perform(*params)
  rescue MyApiRateLimit
    pause_for(Time.now + WAIT_TIME, name)
    rate_limited_requeue(self, klass, *params)
  end

  def self.enqueue(klass, *params)
    rate_limited_enqueue(self, klass, *params)
  end
end
````

## Final thoughts
Thanks to [Dominic](https://github.com/dominicsayers) for idea of renaming the redis key - and the samole  code that does this.

This is my first gem - so please forgive any errors - and feedback very welcome
